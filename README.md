# code_solution_multiplayer_game

//Following code solution is answered to the best of my knowledge:

//Assumption(NOTE) : Here if the top_card generated after distributing cards to each player is an action card (a KING, QUEEN, JACK, ACE) of any suit then that top_card is 
                     looked only for the suit irrespective of the rank by the player.(only at beginning of the game)
                     i.e. the first player has to play a card with the same suit as that of the top_card.

//Main function can be used to run the game :)

//The entity class consist of Cards.java , Deck.java and Player.java
//The service class consist of CardGame.java --> where the actual implementation of game is present.
//The test class consists of test cases.
